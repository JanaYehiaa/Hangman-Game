### Overview 
This is the code for a fully functional hangman game written entirely in C++. To run and play this game just download the source code and run it in any environment that supports C++. 

### Description
The game begins by prompting the user to select a theme for the word they will guess. The user has a total of 8 attempts to guess the word, one letter at a time.

The game includes an award system using "gems":
* Each user starts with 4 gems.
* Winning a game adds 2 gems to their total.
* Using a hint (which reveals a letter at a position chosen by the user) subtracts 4 gems.

### Purpose 
Designing and implementing this interactive game has significantly enhanced our understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++. This project also emphasized the practical application of Standard Template Library (STL) data structures and concepts. Additionally, it reinforced key principles such as ensuring proper input validation and writing maintainable, modular code.

### Future Work
* Run the game on a GUI instead of terminal 
* Add different levels of difficulty for user to select from 
* Fix redundancy between UI and Hangman classes 

### Demonstration
